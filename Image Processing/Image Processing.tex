\section{Introduction}
In the MonoSLAM approach presented by Davison, the primary sensor information is gathered from a \textbf{single} low-cost digital camera. The following section, first and foremost, aims to present a mathematical and geometrical approach to the modelling of the aforementioned camera in its ideal form. Thereafter, the ideal model can be modified to incorporate the effects of non-idealities such as distortion. This section will also provide a sufficient approach to reconstruct an estimate of the original three dimensional position form a sequence of two dimensional data contained within the cameras images.   
\subsection{The Pinhole Camera Model}
This classical model provides a reasonable approximation of a three-dimensional point in world and approximates this position according to a 2-dimensional plane. Though this model is widely utilised in the computer vision field, it is important to note that the model itself is an approximation that incorporates a number of assumptions. The models convenience as well as its simplicity make it a popular choice within practice. The model though, can be adapted to limit certain assumptions and better approximate the properties that coincide with available digital cameras.
\subsubsection{Description of the Model}
The pinhole camera model can be described as a two-dimensional plane, containing the projections of the three dimensional coordinate. The process of representing a 3D coordinate in terms of a 2D coordinate is known as \textit{perspective projection}. The two-dimensional plane is commonly referred to as the \textit{pinhole plane} which contains a infinitesimal hole at its centre - the \textit{pinhole}. The camera possess its own 3D coordinate system with coordinate axes $X_C$, $Y_C$ and $Z_C$ (also referred to as the cameras \textit{optical axis}). The pinhole is situated at the origin of this 3D coordinate system - this is also referred to as the \textit{optical centre}, \textit{O}. The image plane is located at a positive distance \textit{f} from the optical centre \textit{O} along the negative $Z_C$-axis and is parallel to the pinhole plane.
