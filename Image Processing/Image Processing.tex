\section{Introduction}In MonoSLAM, the primary sensor information is gathered from a \textbf{single} standard low-cost USB digital camera. The following section will first present an ideal camera in terms of a mathematical model and show how this ideal model can be modified with a distortion model to better fit the imperfections presented by real camera lenses. Also, this section will explain the manner in which 3-dimensional positions can be estimated from the relevant 2-dimensional data in subsequent camera images.

\subsection{The Pinhole Camera Model}
This classical model provides a reasonable approximation of a three-dimensional point in world and approximates this positional according to a 2-dimensional plane. This plane is referred to as the \textit{pinhole plane} and consists of an infinitesimal hole - the pinhole. The pinhole corresponds to the origin $O$ of the camera's own 3-dimensional coordinate system and is also known as the optical centre of the camera.
